Documentation for the module is available at [github](https://britram.github.io/python-ipfix).

      "\n",
      "- The application's data flow is fundamentally unidirectional. IPFIX is a \"push\" protocol, supporting only the export of information from a sender (an Exporting Process) to a receiver (a Collecting Process).  Request-response interactions are not supported by IPFIX.\n",
      "- The application handles discrete event information, or information to be periodically reported.  IPFIX is particularly well suited to representing events, which can be scoped in time.\n",
      "- The application handles information about network entities. IPFIX's information model is network-oriented, so network management applications have many opportunities for information model reuse.\n",
      "- The application requires a small number of arrangements of data structures relative to the number of records it handles.  The template-driven self-description mechanism used by IPFIX excels at handling large volumes of identically structured data, compared to representations which define structure inline with data (such as XML).\n",
      "\n",
      "To take an example, let's use IPFIX to solve a common problem during meetings, conferences, and classes: meeting room temperature. Let's say we have a table of observation point identifiers to meeting room names, and use IPFIX to periodically export ambient temperature information for a given machine.
