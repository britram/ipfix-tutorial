      "Beyond Flow Export\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, we've explored the use of IPFIX for flow export; however, the protocol is useful for any application to which the following applies:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The application's data flow is fundamentally unidirectional. IPFIX is a \"push\" protocol, supporting only the export of information from a sender (an Exporting Process) to a receiver (a Collecting Process).  Request-response interactions are not supported by IPFIX.\n",
      "- The application handles discrete event information, or information to be periodically reported.  IPFIX is particularly well suited to representing events, which can be scoped in time.\n",
      "- The application handles information about network entities. IPFIX's information model is network-oriented, so network management applications have many opportunities for information model reuse.\n",
      "- The application requires a small number of arrangements of data structures relative to the number of records it handles.  The template-driven self-description mechanism used by IPFIX excels at handling large volumes of identically structured data, compared to representations which define structure inline with data (such as XML).\n",
      "\n",
      "To take an example, let's use IPFIX to solve a common problem during IETF meetings: meeting room temperature. Let's say we have a table of observation point identifiers to meeting room names, and use IPFIX to periodically export ambient temperature information for a given machine. In an ideal world, we'd write a proper description for the Information Element and send it to IANA, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Name: ambientTemperatureCelsius\n",
      "- Description: The ambient temperature measured in the environment. May be associated with an Observation Point or a Metering Process; otherwise, taken to be the ambient temperature in the environment of the Exporting Process.\n",
      "- Abstract Data Type: float32\n",
      "- Units: degrees Celsius\n",
      "- Range: -273.15 - +infinity\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is just a two hour tutorial, so we'll use an enterprise-specific Information Element instead:"
